          Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust
          thou art, to dust returnest, Was not spoken of the soul.Not enjoyment,
          and not sorrow, Is our destined end or way; But to act, that each
          to-morrow Find us farther than to-day.

          website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My
          goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

          I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed
          to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I
          went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I
          even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100%
          web solution.

        <p>
          They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
          developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it.
          And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
